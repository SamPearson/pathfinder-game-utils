encounter creation
------------------
logic to generate appropriate encounters for hallways, doors(traps) , or open spaces.

pull in array of CR- and environment-appropriate monsters from a DB
if no previous monsters, rand select one from array
xpspent += selectedMonster.exp

		searchForCompanionMonster
